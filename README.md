# Go Game

## Goals
- [x] Create the basic game
- [ ] Implement Carta counting algorithm
- [ ] Train Deep Learning Model on playing the game

## What is this?

This is a minimal Version of the Go board game. It will take it's input from System.in as default but can easily be changed to take other input. Because the board size is settable, the complexity can be reduced at will. 
This might make it possible to try out various unsupervised learning models without the need for a Supercomputer.
Currently the point evaluation is beeing adjusted to fit the best approximation when the both players pass.

See [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_Go) if you are not familiar with the rules of Go.

## Challenges
- [ ] Improve point evaluation accuracy at game end
  - This has shown to be far from trivial
  - [This paper](https://www.oipaz.net/Carta.pdf) seems to be the best solution so far and will be implemented

## Currently beeing worked on
